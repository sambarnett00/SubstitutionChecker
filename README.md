# Substitution Checker
In order to crack some substitution ciphers, we need a heuristic to determine how "decypted" a piece of text is.</br>
Introduce the substitution checker, a model with a encoder transformer architecture to evaluate a piece of text's "decyptedness".

## Problem background
As a part of an exercise in cryptography, I was tasked with decrypting some ciphertext which had been encrypted using a substitution cipher.</br>
